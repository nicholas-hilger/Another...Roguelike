# AnotherRoguelike
Another [adjective] roguelike. Old-fashioned ASCII goodness included. Apologies to any Britons in advance.

A nice roguelike for nice people. In the classic vein of Angband or Nethack. Started as a tutroial using C#, RogueSharp, and RLNet.

Really not sure how far this will go yet. 

Planned Features:

1. Enemy pools
2. Special abilities
3. Unique areas every few floors
4. Various races and classes, and have them not be all generic
5. (Maybe) Side/secret areas
6. A wide variety of equipment and items
7. Corgi Paladin
