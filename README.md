# AnotherRoguelike
Another [adjective] roguelike. Old-fashioned ASCII goodness included. Apologies to any Britons in advance.

A nice roguelike for nice people. Really not sure how far this will go yet.

Planned Features:

1. Roguelike-esque-ish features
2. (Yeah) Special abilities
3. Monsters made by smashing animals with...monsters
4. Full Twitch, Twitter, and Facebook integration (or not)
5. Various races and classes, and have them not be all generic
6. Corgi Paladin
